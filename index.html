            <h2>What is CyberSecurity ?</h2><br>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. 
                These attacks can aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users, 
                or disrupt normal business operations.<br><br>
                Here are some key aspects of cybersecurity:</p><br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Network Security:</b> Protecting the integrity and usability of networks and data.</li><br>
                <li><b>Information Security:</b>Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data.</li><br>
                <li><b>Application Security</b>ecuring software applications from vulnerabilities.</li><br>
                <li><b>Cloud Security:</b>Protecting data and applications in cloud environments.</li><br>
                <li><b>Endpoint Security:</b>Securing devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets.</li><br>
                <li><b>Critical Infrastructure Security:</b>Protecting essential systems and assets.</li><br>
            </ol>
            <p>Cybersecurity is crucial because cyberattacks can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and damage to 
                an organization’s reputation. With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, robust cybersecurity 
                measures are more important than ever.</p><br>

            <h2>Why is CyberSecurity important?</h2><br>
            <p>Cybersecurity is crucial in today’s digital age due to the vast amount of sensitive information stored 
                and transmitted online. Personal data, financial records, and intellectual property are prime targets 
                for cybercriminals. Effective cybersecurity measures help protect this information from unauthorized 
                access and breaches, ensuring privacy and security for individuals and organizations alike. Without 
                robust cybersecurity, the risk of identity theft, financial loss, and data breaches increases significantly, 
                potentially leading to severe consequences for both individuals and businesses.</p><br>
            <p>Moreover, cybersecurity is essential for maintaining the integrity and functionality of critical infrastructure.
                 As more services and operations move online, the potential impact of cyberattacks on essential services 
                 like power grids, healthcare systems, and communication networks grows. Cybersecurity helps safeguard these 
                 vital systems from disruptions and attacks, ensuring they remain operational and reliable. Additionally, as 
                 cyber threats become more sophisticated, continuous advancements in cybersecurity are necessary to stay ahead of 
                 potential risks, making it a fundamental aspect of modern society’s safety and resilience.</p>
